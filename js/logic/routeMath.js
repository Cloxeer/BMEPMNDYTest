/**
 * @file js/logic/routeMath.js
 * @summary The maths of finding a route on a network of paths. No page or map code here.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES : A "network" is every path, street or road of one travel mode
 *                (data/routes/walk.geojson, ...), turned into a graph: points
 *                joined by segments. These functions:
 *                  - give each segment its cost (its length; one-way streets one way only),
 *                  - remember which way (street name) every segment is on,
 *                  - find the network point nearest to a place,
 *                  - pick where a route should start and end, and the shortest route.
 *                The shortest route itself is found by geojson-path-finder
 *                (Dijkstra's algorithm), which directions.js loads.
 * DEPENDS ON   : ./geo.js
 * USED BY      : js/directions/routeData.js, js/directions/directions.js
